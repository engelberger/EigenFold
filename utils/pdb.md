# pdb.py

This script `pdb.py` is part of a larger program called EigenFold, which is used for protein structure prediction. It provides several functions and a class to process and manipulate protein structures in PDB (Protein Data Bank) format. Let's break it down into sections.

## Imports and Initial Setup

The script begins by importing necessary packages, including `torch`, `os`, `warnings`, `io`, `subprocess`, and several modules from `Bio.PDB`. The script also defines some constants and sets up a logger to help with debugging.

```python
import torch, os, warnings, io, subprocess
from Bio.PDB import PDBIO, Chain, Residue, Polypeptide, Atom, PDBParser
from Bio import pairwise2
import numpy as np
from Bio.PDB.PDBExceptions import PDBConstructionWarning
parser = PDBParser()
from .logging import get_logger
logger = get_logger(__name__)
from .protein_residues import normal as RESIDUES
from Bio.SeqUtils import seq1, seq3
```

## PROCESS_RESIDUES Function

The `PROCESS_RESIDUES` function processes the `RESIDUES` constant, which contains information about the amino acids in a protein. It modifies the dictionary to map amino acid names to their corresponding atomic symbols and removes any 'H' and 'CA' atoms.

```python
def PROCESS_RESIDUES(d):
    ...
    return d
    
RESIDUES = PROCESS_RESIDUES(RESIDUES)
```

## pdb_to_npy Function

The `pdb_to_npy` function takes a PDB file and converts it into a numpy array. It takes the path to the PDB file, an optional model number, chain ID, and sequence as input parameters. It reads the protein structure from the file, processes the chain, and returns an array of coordinates and the sequence of amino acids.

```python
def pdb_to_npy(pdb_path, model_num=0, chain_id=None, seqres=None):
    ...
    return coords_, mask
```

## tmscore Function

The `tmscore` function computes several scores between two protein structures given their PDB file paths. It uses the external tools 'TMscore' and 'lddt' to compute the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation), TM-score, GDT-TS, GDT-HA, and LDDT scores.

```python
def tmscore(X_path, Y_path, molseq=None, lddt=True, lddt_start=1):
    ...
    return {'rmsd': rmsd, 'tm': tm, 'gdt_ts': gdt_ts, 'gdt_ha': gdt_ha, 'lddt': lddt}
```

## PDBFile Class

The `PDBFile` class is used to create and manipulate PDB files. It has an `__init__` method that initializes the protein structure with a given sequence. It also has several methods for adding coordinates to the structure, clearing the structure, and writing the structure to a file or returning it as a string.

```python
class PDBFile:
    ...
```

## renumber_pdb Function

The `renumber_pdb` function renumbers the residues in a PDB file according to a given sequence, starting from a specified index. This can be useful for aligning protein structures.

```python
def renumber_pdb(molseq, X_path, X_renum, start=1):
    ...
```

In summary, `pdb.py` provides functions and a class for processing, converting, and manipulating protein structures in PDB format. It is part of the EigenFold project, which is used for predicting protein structures.
